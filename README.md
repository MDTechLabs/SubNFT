# SubNFT
SubNFT is an open-source tool for issuing time-locked subscription NFTs. It allows creators to gate access to GitHub repos and content based on NFT ownership. When the subscription period ends, access is revoked automatically, providing developers with a decentralized, recurring revenue model.
